Hi, I'm David! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a front-end web developer and recent graduate of Le Wagonâ€™s bootcamp in Montreal, where I focused on mastering the skills needed to build engaging, user-friendly websites and applications.

After 8 years working in the film industry, I made a career change into tech, combining my passion for creativity and problem-solving with technical skills. During my bootcamp, I learned technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Ruby on Rails, and Git/GitHub. Iâ€™m currently deepening my skills by learning React.

One of my proudest achievements so far is creating Filmdash, a TV show recommendation app, which I developed with a team in just 2 weeks as part of my bootcamp project. It matches users with shows based on their preferences and streaming platforms, and I had the chance to work with Vue.js and Ruby on Rails to bring it to life.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - A TV show recommendation app, where I'm refining my skills in front-end technologies and creating a smooth user experience.
  - My portfolio website using React, which will showcase my projects, skills, and journey as a developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React
- âš¡ Fun fact: In addition to French (my native language), Iâ€™m fluent in English and Spanish.

Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me if you want to collaborate or just chat about web development!
